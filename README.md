# Brokers Test A B

A/B test project for broker listing UI. This project displays broker information in both desktop and mobile formats, with randomized presentation for A/B testing.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. The list of brokers will be rendered for both desktop and mobile containers.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `main.js`: Unified JavaScript for rendering brokers (replaces scripts.js and scriptsMobile.js).
- `styles.css`: Styles for the broker cards and layout.

## Optimization
- Single JS file for both desktop and mobile.
- Clean, maintainable structure.

[IT] - Broker Listing vs Reviews Snapshots AB Test

Description
Conduct an AB test comparing two versions:

Reviews Snapshot – Focused on broker reviews.

Broker Listing Snapshot – Focused on a list of brokers.

Each version should be displayed 50% of the time.

Broker Order
The broker order should follow these guidelines:

Both versions: Pepperstone, XM, Moneta, TradingPro.

Broker Listing Snapshot only: FxPro, IC Markets, Octa.

Objective
The goal is to compare the performance of the Reviews Snapshot format against the Broker Listing Snapshot, determining which approach is more effective in driving value for BL/Reviews advertisers.

Definition of Done
Both versions should use similar screen space.

The listed brokers should be almost identical, except for the additional brokers required for the Broker Listing Snapshot.

Implementation Plan Using innerHTML
Data Preparation
Extract broker data in a structured format for each version.

Ensure the required brokers are included in the appropriate dataset.

AB Test Logic
Use a randomization method to display either Reviews Snapshot or Broker Listing Snapshot. Use FXStreet.Global.RandomClient that returns a integer.

Ensure an even split (50/50) in test distribution.

Dynamic HTML Rendering
Create a container element within the widget.

Use JavaScript to dynamically generate and inject HTML content using innerHTML.

Maintain a responsive layout to ensure usability across various screen sizes.

Styling and Design
Reuse CSS styles to ensure consistency and visual clarity.

Use a flexible layout structure that adapts to different screen resolutions.

Analytics Integration
Track user interactions with broker links to gather performance data.

Capture test version details for analysis.

Accessibility Considerations
Ensure proper semantic structure for screen reader compatibility.

Implement clear focus states for interactive elements.

Final Notes
This approach ensures dynamic content rendering without requiring React, maintaining efficiency while allowing seamless integration into the Sitefinity CMS environment. The test implementation should provide measurable insights into which format performs better for engagement and conversion rates.
